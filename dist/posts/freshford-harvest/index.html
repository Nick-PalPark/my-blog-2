MY FIRST SEED HARVEST OF THE SEASON with Glorious Grasslands was a long way down. At the very bottom of the Cotswolds, the fields were bursting with life and color. It was hard work, but the sense of accomplishment at the end of the day made it all worthwhile.

Working alongside the team, I learned a lot about the different grasses and wildflowers. The experience has deepened my appreciation for the landscape and the people who care for it.

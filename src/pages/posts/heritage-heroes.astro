    A MID MORNING APPOINTMENT AT THE council chambers at Ebley where the students at the Star College were presented with their awards. It was inspiring to see their hard work and dedication recognized in such a formal setting.

    The ceremony was filled with proud smiles, applause, and a real sense of achievement. It’s moments like these that remind me of the importance of community and celebrating each other’s successes.

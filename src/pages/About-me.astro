<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there — I’m Nick, and this blog is a reflection of what I’m building, learning, and questioning.</p>

<h2>🎯 What I Do</h2>
<p>I specialize in strategic transitions, intellectual property, and organizational clarity — often at the intersection of tech, law, and diplomacy.</p>

<h2>🧩 Why I Started This Site</h2>
<p>After navigating complex corporate pivots and diving deep into modular dashboard creation, I wanted a space that’s both technically curious and personally honest. Enter: Nick’s Diary.</p>

<h2>🔍 Topics I Explore</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tech workflows & automation</li>
  <li>Language, meaning & accessibility</li>
  <li>Innovation, IP, and fairness</li>
  <li>Personal transitions and decision-making</li>
</ul>

<h2>✨ Random Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Big fan of structured problem-solving and dashboards that don’t waste a click</li>
  <li>Reads legal docs like bedtime stories</li>
  <li>Secretly enjoys wrangling CI errors (well, almost)</li>
</ul>

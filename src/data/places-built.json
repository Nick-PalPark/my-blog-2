        "text": "One of the most popular bagel places Korea. The concept is cool to elevate bagels from bakery to restaurant-style dining. Super long queue and getting better when they are opening more branches across Korea.\n\nThe bagels are good but the texture is more on the bread side than the New York chewy style.\n\nTheir bagel spreads though are more noteworthy as there are quite a number of flavours to choose from. My personal favourite is the maple pecan spread!",

People at LBM are attentive and adorable, they will guide u to make reservation and you also have free drink and seat while waiting. My order is jalapeno bagel with sausage inside, and the truffle soup, both of them are very good-looking and yummy especially the smell of truffle 🥰. But I did not happy with my seat because its view toward the wall, that not nice to me",

Signed up on the wait-list, and notified there were 121 parties ahead of us.  Yes, that's right .... We were the 122 party in line.  Luckily, there are plenty of other shops and cool unique restaurants in the neighborhood.... We walked around, ate at 2 other places, did some shopping and then our number was finally up.....3 hours later.  Was it worth the wait?  Hmmm, the bagels were definitely soft, chewy and very delicious.... And the spreads and side dishes were also good.... Prices were on the high side for bagels, but there was definitely a selection of bagels not typical at other regular bagel shops.  The interior and vibe evoked a small Inn in the English countryside, but the crowds reminded you that you may be at a tourist spot.  If you want to come, just be prepared to wait.  A long time.",

There was already a long line of eager bagel enthusiasts waiting to get inside. After about a 30-minute wait, I finally got in, and it was totally worth it.\n\nThe bagels? Simply divine. Freshly baked, perfectly soft, and with an incredible texture that keeps you coming back for more. If you’re unsure what to try, I can’t recommend the ham and cheese bagel enough…it’s a knockout! Pair it with their fantastic coffee, and you’ve got the perfect breakfast combo.\n\nPlanning a visit? I recommend going on a weekday early in the morning to beat the crowds. Just be prepared for a bit of a wait…trust me, it’s all part of the experience!",

        "text": "I have been wanting to go here for years already. The queue is always so long especially when it gets busier during the day. After almost 4 failed attempts, we finally got to try during our last visit!\n\nThe tip is to ARRIVE EARLY. They have remote queueing after 9am, but the queue is already too long by then. We planned this way in advance so it was a non-negotiable that we should be there by 7am. When we arrived around 7:15am on a Thursday, we were already 10th in line for dine-in. We waited until opening and got to enter within 10 minutes.\n\nWhen you enter, you’ll be a bit overwhelmed with the amount of bagels you’ll encounter. We were so tempted to try everything! We got a few for dine-in and a few for takeaway. We also ordered the truffle soup, it was good and filling but a bit pricey for what it is in my opinion (around 12,800won). You’ll need to order and pay first then someone will assist you to a table. Very good service even if it’s very busy!\n\nThe bagels were really good!! I’d love to go back to try the other flavors and the spreads! I also love the concept of the brand (similar to their other cafes like Cafe Layered & Artist Bakery).",

Using the salt and sauce helped a bit but not much. 5/10\n\nThe seafood pancakes were the best thing that we ate. 7/10\n\nThe service here completely sucks. Our waitress was rude and didn’t even give us much time to even look at the menu before storming over and demanding we order. When we ordered, she said we needed to order the dishes equal to the amount of people we had with a snarky attitude. OK, it would had been nice to know that rule first. She then kept rushing us to order like calm down, you just told us this rule and we need some time to look at the menu. The place was mostly empty so not sure why she was rushing us.\n\nAlso, a warning that the drink they gave us when we sat down is straight up liquor would had been nice before we drank it thinking it was tea. We thought they’d only give us the ginseng shot after you order the chicken but they just straight up gave it to us right when we sat down.\n\nOnly good thing was there was no line.",
